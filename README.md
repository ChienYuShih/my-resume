## A/B Testing: Skills Section
In this project, I created two different versions of the Skills section to practice A/B testing using Git branches and pull requests.

### Version A (Progress Bars) ✅ Selected
- Skills are shown with progress bars.
- Easier to understand at a glance.
- I merged this version into `main` for better clarity and readability.

### Version B (Tag Cloud) ❌ Not merged
- Skills are shown as a tag cloud with hover effect.
- Looks playful, but does not clearly show skill levels.
- This version stays in a separate branch / PR for comparison.

## git revert practice
I used `git revert` to undo one commit (without using reset), because I needed to demonstrate safe version rollback with clear history for this assignment.
