## A/B Testing: Skills Section

In this project, I created two different versions of the Skills section to practice A/B testing using Git branches and pull requests.

**Version A (Progress Bars)**  
This version presents skills using progress bars. It clearly shows my skill levels and is easy to understand at a glance. I decided to merge this version into the main branch because it provides clearer information and better readability for viewers.

**Version B (Tag Cloud)**  
This version presents skills as a tag cloud with hover effects. Although it looks more playful and interactive, it does not clearly indicate skill proficiency levels. Therefore, this version was kept in a separate branch and was not merged into the main branch.

Through this A/B testing process, I learned how to compare different design approaches using Git branches and how to make design decisions based on clarity and user experience.
